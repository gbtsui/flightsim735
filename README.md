# flightsim735

This is the repository for files used in the 735 Firebird Flight Simulator. 
It's a simplistic flight simulator designed for minimal cost while still being powerful enough to be used as a training aid
for ground school. We do not represent the Department of National Defense, we just made this repo for open sourcing.
